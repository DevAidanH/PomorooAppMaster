# pomorooMaster

Built entirely with vanilla javascript, Pomoroo is a productivity app that uses the pomodoro technique, a method that breaks up tasks into 25-minute intervals with a 5-minute break, to help users get stuff done! Users can also add that tasks they want to achieve, mark them as completed, and change the length of the timers to fit their needs. (This is the current website version)
